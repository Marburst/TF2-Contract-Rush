# TF2-Contract-Rush

This is a manual APWorld for Team Fortress 2. The gameplay involves completing "contracts", which are small objectives for each class, weapon, and gamemode. Players begin with one class, one map, and all of the stock weapons. The goal is to collect 10 Bars of Australium to complete the game.

During your gameplay, you may receive trap items. Any of these labeled as a temporary debuff is intended to last until you get a kill, or, for a more challenging experience, last until you complete a check. Which rule you'd like to follow is up to you. There's also one permanent debuff, which lasts until you complete your goal. Have fun!

This APWorld currently assumes that you have all of the unlockable weapons. Adding an option for players to select which weapons they want to be included would be the #1 priority for a second iteration of this APWorld; as of now, if you don't have a weapon, you can just auto-complete its contracts.
