# TF2-Contract-Rush

This is a manual APWorld for Team Fortress 2. The gameplay involves completing "contracts", which are small objectives for each class, weapon, and gamemode. Players begin with one class, one map, and all of the stock weapons. The goal is to collect 10 Bars of Australium to complete the game.

This APWorld currently assumes that you have all of the unlockable weapons. Adding an option for players to select which weapons they want to be included would be the #1 priority for a second iteration of this APWorld; as of now, if you don't have a weapon, you can just auto-complete its contracts.
